Welcome to BioSim 2020's documentation!
=======================================
This is a simulation of Rossum√∏ya, a small island in the middle of
the vast ocean, containing different landscape types like Jungle,
Savannah, Desert, Mountain and Ocean. There are faunas in the island and
it includes Carnivores and Herbivores. Carnivores feed on herbivores and
herbivores feed on plant foods available on the island. Here we do simulation
to see whether both species of fauna survive for long term in the island.
Some of the characteristic are:

* Herbivores depend on a good supply of fodder to survive and reproduce.
* Carnivores depend on the availability of prey. Carnivores are more mobile than herbivores.
* Jungle provides large amounts of fodder even under intense grazing.
* Savannah provides a limited amout of fodder.
* Desert does not provide fodder for herbivores.
* Mountain is impassable for herbi- and carnivores.
* Ocean is impassable for both species.
